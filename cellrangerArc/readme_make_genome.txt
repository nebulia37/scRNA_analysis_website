1. cat Macaca_mulatta.Mmul_10.dna.toplevel.fa and SIVmac251.fa to get Mmul10_SIV.fa
2. cat Macaca_mulatta.Mmul_10.114.gtf and SIVmac251.gtf to get Mmul10_SIV.gtf
3, make monkey_config.csv file in script folder
3. Use Mmul10_SIV.fa and Mmul10_SIV.gtf to build the genome folder Macaca_mulatta_Mmul_10_114_SIVmac251_withMotif using the code in script named make_customized_genome.sh
